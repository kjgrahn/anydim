.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B anydim
simply prints the width and height of the image files given
as command-line arguments.
If none are given, it reads standard input instead.
.PP
Just like
.BR file (1),
.B anydim
takes care not to read more data than needed.
The main reason I don't use
.B file
is that it only prints the dimensions of some image formats.
.
.SS "Supported file formats"
.IP JPEG
Plain JFIF or EXIF; progressive JPEG.
.IP PNG
.IP PNM
PPM, PGM and PPM in both the
.I plain
and the more common
.I raw
forms.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.BP \-i
Print the MIME type of each image along with its dimensions,
e.g.
.br
.IR image/jpeg\~1009\~948 .
.BP \-H
Print the image file name, even if only one file was given.
.BP \-h
Never print the image file name.
.
.SH "EXIT CODE"
Non-zero if at least one image failed to yield its dimensions.
