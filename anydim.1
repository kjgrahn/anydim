.SH "NAME"
anydim \- print width and height of images

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B anydim
simply prints the width and height of the image files given
as command-line arguments.
If none are given, it reads standard input instead.
.PP
Just like
.BR file (1),
.B anydim
takes care not to read more data than needed.
The main reason I don't use
.B file
is that it only prints the dimensions of some image formats.
.PP
Or anyway, that's what it
.I used
to do in 2011.  In 2019, file 5.35 on Linux
.I does
print the dimensions; the OpenBSD version does not.
.
.SS "Supported file formats"
.IP JPEG
Plain JFIF or EXIF; progressive JPEG.
.IP
Note, however, that the EXIF information is
.IR ignored ,
with may mean that the dimensions are shown as if a portrait image is
rotated to landscape mode.
.IP PNG
Portable Network Graphics.
.IP PNM
PPM, PGM and PPM in both the
.I plain
and the more common
.I raw
forms.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.BP \-i
Print the MIME type of each image along with its dimensions,
e.g.
.br
.IR image/jpeg\~1009\~948 .
.BP \-H
Print the image file name, even if only one file was given.
.BP \-h
Never print the image file name.
.
.BP --landscape\fP,\ \fP\-L
Print dimensions in landscape mode, i.e. as
.I "height width"
if the image is higher than it is wide.
Useful if you're more interested in image sizes and less
interested in how the images are rotated.
.
.SH "EXIT CODE"
Non-zero if at least one image failed to yield its dimensions.
.
.SH "BUGS"
Other popular image file formats should be included.
If nothing else, at least
.B gzipped
versions of the ones mentioned above.
.PP
There should (see above) be better support for EXIF.
