_________________________________________

anydim 1.1 (2010-01-07):

- Support for PPM/PGM/PBM images.
- Added a bunch of unit tests.

anydim 1.0 (2010-01-05):

- Support for PNG files, too.
- Support for reading from standard input, for printing the MIME type,
  and for forcing printing of file names.
- Bug fixes.

anydim 0.2 (2010-01-04):

- Bug fix: failed to discard entropy-encoded data after RSTn markers.
  This caused failures for only a minority of all images, I suppose
  because the end of such data rarely occurs within the first 4 KB.
- Support the SOF1, SOF9 and SOF10 segments along with SOF0 and SOF2,
  just like libjpeg does.

anydim 0.1 (2010-01-03):

- First, incomplete release.
